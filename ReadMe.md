Name: Onyemowo Akwubo (Mowo)
My attempt at the SCA Frontend Channel's Code Blossom Challenge.

Design Choices: 
- Semantic HTML: for structure
- CSS Flexbox: for layout
- Pseudo Classes: for replicating logo and input field interactions.
- Linear Gradients: for background

Challenges:
- Lack of assets (images, fonts typeface, and colors) to enable replication of design.
